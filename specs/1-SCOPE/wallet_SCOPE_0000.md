## Summary
[summary]: #summary

The WALLET will be the human interface for interacting with the IOTA Tangle. It will serve as a
portal for IOTA investors to manage their funds and communicate with other users. The application
dashboard will centre around a contacts page and decentralised chat system. Its primary purpose
is to improve the user experience when transacting with IOTA tokens.

The application will be inherently modular and extensible to enable plugin development by third
parties and the repurposing of functionality within other applications.

As part of a later phase, the application with also serve as a self-sovereign identity and data
management platform. Combining financial and identity management Trinity will provide the same
functionality as a conventional physical WALLET.

## Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

The WALLET is the IOTA Foundationâ€™s flagship user-facing product. It is the primary route through
which users manage their IOTA tokens.

The WALLET presents the perfect environment to showcase the human-to-human capabilities of the IOTA protocol and thereby serve as a
testbed for third-parties to develop relevant IOTA use cases.

## Product Introduction
[product]: #product
<!--
Talk about the business reasons for the product's existence, what it is for and who it serves.
-->

## Stakeholders
[stakeholders]: #stakeholders
<!--
- Who are the stakeholders?
- How has the community been involved?
-->


## Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation
<!--
Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the language and you were
teaching it to another programmer. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how programmers should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact the
 way they use this software. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing programmers
and new programmers.
-->

## Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art
<!--
Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- For language, library, tooling, and compiler proposals: Does this feature
exist in other similar projects and what experience have their community had?
- For community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their
experiences with it?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you
have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether
they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other projects.
-->

## Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

<!--
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the spec process
before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation
of this product?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this prodect that could
be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out it?
-->

## Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities
<!--
Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would
be and how it would affect the language and project as a whole in a holistic
way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible
interactions with the project in your proposal.

Also consider how the this all fits into the roadmap for the project
and of the relevant sub-team.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.
