## Summary
[summary]: #summary

The Actor Model is a design paradigm that...


## Requirements
[requirements]: #requirements


## Considerations
[considerations]: #considerations

As opposed to monolithic apps, a project that utilises the Actor Model has several advantages.

### Alternatives Considered
[alternatives]: #alternatives

List of other approaches.

### Performance Implications
[performance]: #performance

Honest analysis of performance implications.

### Dependencies
[dependencies]: #dependencies

New dependencies introduced.

### Engineering Impact
[engineering-impact]: #engineering-impact
- How will engineering be impacted?
- Are there other projects that need to be adapted?

### Platforms and Environments
[platforms]: #platforms

What platforms and environments will this address?

### Security Impact
[security]: #security

Are there any known impacts (positive or negative) regarding the security posture?

### Tutorials
[tutorials]: #tutorials

Are there tutorials that help illustrate this?

### Examples
[examples]: #examples

Are there examples of this in the wild?

### Compatibility
[compatibility]: #compatibility

Are there compatibility concerns?


## Technical Proposal
[technical-proposal]: #technical-proposal

### Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

### Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?
